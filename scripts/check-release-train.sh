# Refuses to pack a release whose engine pin is not the release version.
#
# Ported from phoenixmldb-xslt, where it exists because published PhoenixmlDb.Xslt 1.6.13
# depends on PhoenixmlDb.XQuery 1.6.12 — the XSLT tag was cut before the XQuery push. Nothing
# was "wrong" at pack time, since the pin was the latest published version, so a staleness
# check cannot catch it. Only an equality check can:
#
#   if this train is 1.8.0, every train-locked pin must read 1.8.0.
#
# Why this repo needs it. `xslt-mcp` ships an MCP server that EMBEDS the engine: a user who
# installs xslt-mcp 1.8.0 is running whatever PhoenixmlDb.Xslt this pin names. Without an
# equality check the tool and the engine drift silently, which is exactly what happened — this
# repo sat pinned at 1.6.14 through the entire 1.7.0 train and nothing said so. check-pins.sh
# catches a pin that has fallen behind what is PUBLISHED; only this catches a pin that has
# fallen behind the train being released.
#
# Mark a pin with "check-pins: train-locked" in the comment above it to opt in. Packages on
# their own cadence are deliberately not locked.
